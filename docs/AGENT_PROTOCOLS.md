# Agent Protocols & Interoperability Standards

Protocols enable agents to communicate consistently with tools, APIs, and each other.

---

### 1. MCP — Model Context Protocol

- Standard tool interface definition  
- Structured request/response formats  
- Capability discovery  
- Safeguards around tool usage  

Used in Anthropic, OpenAI, and multi-agent ecosystems.

---

### 2. A2A — Agent-to-Agent Protocol

Defines how agents:
- message each other  
- coordinate tasks  
- negotiate responsibilities  
- exchange structured states  

Useful for multi-agent orchestration.

---

### 3. SLIM & ACP

Lightweight protocols offering:
- secure tool execution  
- standardized schemas  
- portable tool configurations  

---

### 4. LangGraph (Workflow Protocol)

- Graph-defined state transitions  
- Deterministic agent workflows  
- Retry loops, branching logic  
- Memory-aware node execution  

---

### Summary
Protocols bring safety, predictability, and portability to Agentic AI systems.
